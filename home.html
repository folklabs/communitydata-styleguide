      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>Having seen a need among local community groups for accurate, persuasive and well-presented data visualisations, we decided to build a platform where they could create data visualisations and be mentored by expert volunteer mentors.</p>
      <p>But there was no platform or space to build a strong, networked community of data experts who could voluntarily contribute to creating such visualisations. In fact, there is some controversy over data visualisation at present. The tools for producing such visualisations are often controlled by graphic designers and other creatives who do not possess the necessary skills to ensure their visualisations are accurate and robust.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
      <p>COD is for everyone who wants to create beautiful, accurate, shareable data visualisations:
      <ul>
        <li>Perhaps you’re a local community group leader trying to win a funding bid by presenting compelling evidence of the need for money to be donated to your cause or project?</li>
        <li>You might be a local government official with dozens of questions and not enough internal data experts to answer them all.</li>
        <li>Or you might be an entrepreneur seeking a reliable way to explore information about an area where you hope to start a business.</li>
        <li>You may even just be a citizen, concerned about an issue affecting you in your local area that you want to do something about.</li>
