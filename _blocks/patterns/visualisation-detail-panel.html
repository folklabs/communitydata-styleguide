    <p>Hi guys. This map shows the number of planning permission requests that have been made between January 2012 and January 2013 in the Kennington area because I wanted to compare how many applications are being granted with the total number of applications. Looks like about 56% are being granted on average across the year but the peak application success time is around August, with no discernible increase in the number of applications in the previous three months which you’d think might otherwise account for the increase.</p>
    <p>So, if you’re hoping to have your application approved, this graph suggests your best bet would probably to submit the application around July.</p>
